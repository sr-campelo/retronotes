## Warning
Notice that I build this theme for myself and probably will not work with most of the plugins because of the contrast colors. Feel free to add issues and pull requests. I will work on them to improve your experience.

## Retro Style
### Philosophy
RetroNotes 2.0 embraces a minimalist path to productivity.
**RetroNotes principles**:
- **Less is More**: we don't need flashy elements to work, only a satisfying color palette.
- **No Distraction**: only highlighted the essential.
- **Writing-Centered**: everything is about the writing experience.

### Additional Themes
There are four additional light color schemes and five dark color schemes to suit different preferences and moods. Each theme provides a unique visual experience combining aesthetics and functionality.
